PLEASE NOTE: This mod is no longer necessary, as "TMaterials - Glass" now patches Dubs Skylights itself (when using XML Extensions). I am leaving the mod up so saves wont break, and in case anyone cannot use XML Extensions for some reason, but you do not need to use this mod anymore.

Original Description:

Patches the skylights in Dubs Skylights mod to use the Glass from test's "TMaterials - Glass" mod. It will also patch the additional skylight sizes added by BJR1984's "Dubs Skylights Addon" mod. 

Dubs Skylights - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=833899765
Dubs Skylights Addon - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2016959026

TMaterials - Glass - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2845463213

Also removes the "Glass Pane" recipe and item from the Dubs Skylights mod

Requires Dubs Skylights. Will not modify anything unless there is an item with the defName "TMaterials_Glass".

Not compatible with my other mod, "Dubs Skylights Glass+Lights Patch". Please choose either this mod or that mod, depending on whether you want to use the glass from "TMaterials - Glass", or the glass from "Glass+Lights"/"Just Glass".

Change Log:

Version 0.1.1.0 - Created for RimWorld version 1.4.

Version 0.1.1.1 - Added support for users still on RimWorld version 1.3.

Version 0.1.2.0 - Updated mod description to indicate that this mod is no longer necessary, as "TMaterials - Glass" now patches Dubs Skylights itself (when using XML Extensions). I am leaving the mod up so saves wont break, and in case anyone cannot use XML Extensions for some reason, but you do not need to use this mod anymore.

Version 0.1.3.0 - Updated for RimWorld version 1.5.
